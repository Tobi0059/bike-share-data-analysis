## Project Summary

This project analyzes bike-share usage data to understand rider behavior and identify
opportunities to increase ridership. The analysis compares member and casual riders,
examines peak usage times, and identifies high-demand stations using data visualization.
Key insights show that casual riders dominate weekend usage, while members primarily
ride during weekday commute hours. Based on these findings, recommendations were made
to improve bike availability, target marketing efforts, and support data-driven
decision-making for operational growth.
## Tools Used

- **Python** – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib** – Creating line charts and bar charts  
- **Seaborn** – Creating heatmaps for usage patterns  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis environment  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project sharing

## Visualizations

### Total Trips per Day

**Insight:**  
Ridership fluctuates throughout the week, with higher usage toward midweek and weekends,
indicating opportunities to target promotions and improve bike availability on high-demand days.

**Insight:**  
Stations A, C, and F have the highest number of trips, suggesting these locations require
priority bike rebalancing and maintenance support.

**Insight:**  
The heatmap shows peak usage during morning and evening commute hours on weekdays,
while weekend usage is more evenly distributed throughout the day.

## Key Insights

- Ridership varies throughout the week, with increased usage toward midweek and weekends.
- Member riders primarily use bikes during weekday commute hours.
- Casual riders tend to ride longer and use bikes more frequently on weekends.
- Stations A, C, and F consistently experience the highest demand.
- Peak usage occurs during morning and evening commute times.


## Recommendations

- Reallocate bikes to high-demand stations during peak hours to reduce shortages.
- Increase bike availability at Stations A, C, and F through improved rebalancing.
- Target casual riders with weekend promotions and short-term ride passes.
- Encourage frequent weekday riders to convert to memberships through commuter incentives.
- Use usage trends to guide future station expansion and operational planning.
