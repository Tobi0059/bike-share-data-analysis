## Project Summary

This project analyzes bike-share usage data to understand rider behavior and identify
opportunities to increase ridership. The analysis compares member and casual riders,
examines peak usage times, and identifies high-demand stations using data visualization.
Key insights show that casual riders dominate weekend usage, while members primarily
ride during weekday commute hours. Based on these findings, recommendations were made
to improve bike availability, target marketing efforts, and support data-driven
decision-making for operational growth.
